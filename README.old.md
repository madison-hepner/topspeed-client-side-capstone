# topspeed-client-side-capstone
In the world of technology that is ever changing, applications become out of date and lose appeal quickly - and in turn lose users despite the original functionality and purpose. This is an issue that becomes blatantly obvious in the scene of cars and car forums, where many sites that would otherwise prove helpful and insightful lose traction due to almost prehistoric looks and functionality compared to modern-day applications.
  
Further, there is an obvious gap between the quality of sites of car companies and their respective forums for working on their cars. This is due to not only companies not wanting to give people much access to work on their own cars for sake of profits, but also due to forums being enthusiast-made without the help of vast professional developer teams that big companies have access to. 
  
The purpose of this capstone is to bridge that gap of quality and functionality and instead bring a modern forum for car enthusiasts to ask their questions and provide information with ease - all the while presenting in standard with applications from big corporations.
