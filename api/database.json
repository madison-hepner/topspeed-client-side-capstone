Can’t believe how smooth the drive is compared to my old Gallardo - albeit I must admit I prefer the Gallardo feeling but as I get older I welcome the refined drive. That said, when I start the car it’s obvious the exhaust valves are open and then after about a min or two they close, the question is shouldn’t the valves go open when I press the Sport button? I can see that if I press the sport button and drive it on Auto that it shifts at higher rpms but the exhaust note is the same whether or sport or not. From what I’ve read this is normal behavior, correct? With alternative being putting in an aftermarket exhaust?Also, I don’t notice any stiffness when putting the suspension on sport - yes, pressing both notes it on the display. Am I missing something?

It has to be a manual and most likely will be a convertible but I'm not opposed to a hardtop if it's a good one. I can see a fair amount of 2006-7 with somewhat low miles 40-80k selling these day around 12-15k. KBB is around 12-13. Any general advice? Things technical to look for (I am very technical used to be a mechanic and I work on other my other cars still) Best years? Worst years? Tips tricks? I appreciate any and all advice. I have yet to even test drive one. Doing that today.",

      "carTypeId": 5,
      "model": "99 E320",
      "content": "I know there's a thread on here where an expert posts a PDF with exhaustive research and knowledge on motor oil and it's effects on a variety of cars and conditions. If someone knows what I'm talking about could they post that here or link it? In the meantime, I've switched my 99 E320 wagon over to synthetic oil and suddenly I have what appears to be a rear seal leak. I actually can't find the source but it drips down where the engine meets the transmission below the little cover under the bell housing or surface plate. Any thoughts on what might cause that that's less trouble than a seal? There are a couple of hoses that are the transmission cooling lines and I just took apart the valve body and cleaned it and put in new springs and valves and a new conductor plate and flushed the ATF. This is definitely not ATF, it's motor oil. Although this dripping started after doing the transmission. My only thought there was that when I got it back together it ran like a new car! It seemed like the power was way up the shifting was perfect and I took it out and ran it up to 4,000 RPMs just to make sure that the limp mode conductor plate speed sensor problem was solved. Could revving it higher than it normally goes cause that leak? It does have 220,000 miles on it.",
